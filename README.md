# ATF_Manufacturing
Cleaned, machine-readable data from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) yearly manufacturing reports for years 2000-2019.

The ATF releases a pdf file each year with manufacturing and export numbers for US-based firearms companies. This data is not easily machine-readable, so I've read the tables into an excel file and manually plugged a few holes.

The yearly totals in the data match those on the cover page of each year's report (except for 2001 where there is a discrepancy within the report itself).
